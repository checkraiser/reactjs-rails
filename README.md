# Introduction

This book is a guide to use Rails with React.js framework.

The aim of the book is to build a blogging platform in which each author could have his own blog.

The project will follow BDD methodology. Each feature should be described with an acceptance test case first before any coding.

Hope you enjoy this journey!
