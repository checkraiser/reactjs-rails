This book is a guide to use Rails with React.js framework.

The aim of the book is to build a blogging platform in which each author could have his own blog.

You will learn how to use latest technologies from Ruby on Rails, React.JS, Flux architecture pattern, Webpack, ES6 javascript, React-Router and Material Design Framework to make a real world web application.

Hope you enjoy this journey!
